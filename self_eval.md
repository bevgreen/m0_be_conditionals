# Self Evaluation #

# 1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? #
 Conditionals evaluate to true or false. Building them in creates different outputs based on what the input is. A conditional is defining what to do with the information that has been input. 
# 2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? #
 Start earlier, practice more. Once I got going it sped up and I understood how to do more complicated conditionals. 

# 3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? #
 It brings me so much satisfaction once the code starts working properly for all your inputs. Inserting "puts" or "print" under a line of code so I could check what it was doing was helpful. I did that if something was erroring or not working properly.
